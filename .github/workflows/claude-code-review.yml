            Focus on critical issues that MUST be fixed before merge:

            **Security & Bugs:**
            - Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, env() usage outside config, etc.)
            - Breaking changes or bugs

            **DRY Principles (Critical):**
            - Code that duplicates existing functionality - check if similar code/components/helpers already exist
            - Reinventing the wheel - using custom solutions when Laravel/Inertia/React/Tailwind has built-in features
            - Unused/dead code being added - imports, functions, components that aren't actually used
            - Flotsam and jetsam - leftover code, commented code, debug statements, console.logs
            - Creating new files when existing ones could be reused or extended

            **Standards Violations:**
            - Check against docs/standards/ - general.md, backend.md, frontend.md, testing.md
            - Laravel anti-patterns (check CLAUDE.md guidelines)
            - Missing/inadequate tests for new features

            Keep feedback concise and actionable. Skip minor style issues that Pint/ESLint will catch.

            Use `gh pr comment` to post your review. If no critical issues, just say "No critical issues found."
